Verstappen returned to the top step of the podium at the Japanese Grand Prix, where he was unchallenged for the majority of the race with teammate Sergio PÃ©rez, who had his first front-row start since the 2023 Miami Grand Prix, and Sainz completing the podium. The race was red-flagged due to a heavy crash that involved Daniel Ricciardo and Alexander Albon, which necessitated repairs to the tyre barriers. Ricciardo's teammate Tsunoda scored a point, making him the first Japanese driver to score points at their home race since Kamui Kobayashi's podium in the 2012 edition of the race.
