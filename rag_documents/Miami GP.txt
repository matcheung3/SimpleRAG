At the next sprint weekend in the Miami Grand Prix, Verstappen took sprint pole and won the sprint ahead of Leclerc and Pérez, while Ricciardo scored his first points of the season with a fourth place. Verstappen took pole for the Grand Prix and led the race in the opening laps before his pit stop. A safety car triggered by Kevin Magnussen and Logan Sargeant allowed Norris to benefit during his pit stop with him re-joining the race in the lead. Norris was able to open a gap to Verstappen in second and took his maiden Formula One victory, having previously held the record of the most podiums without a victory, and giving McLaren their first victory since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix. Verstappen was second from Leclerc, Pérez, Sainz, with Hamilton achieving his best result of the season at that point with sixth. Ocon scored Alpine's first point of the season with tenth place.
