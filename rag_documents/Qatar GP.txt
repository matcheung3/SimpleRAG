McLaren had a chance to secure its ninth World Constructors' Championship title, the first since 1998, at the Qatar Grand Prix. McLaren could win the title as long as they outscored Ferrari and Red Bull in Sunday's race. Sprint polesitter Norris finished behind winner Piastri, for what was to be the final sprint of the season. Verstappen set the fastest time in qualifying, but was demoted one position after the stewards deemed him to have driven unnecessarily slowly on a preparation lap, allowing Russell to inherit pole position. At the start of the race, Verstappen took the lead off Russell, which he held to win the race. Meanwhile, at the back, Esteban Ocon, in his final race with Alpine, was hit into Colapinto by HÃ¼lkenberg, creating a hole in his sidepod and forcing both Ocon and Colapinto to retire from the race. Colapinto's teammate Albon was hit by Lance Stroll, the latter of whom later retired. Lawson joined Albon in spinning and was awarded a penalty after hitting Valtteri Bottas; additionally, Hamilton received a penalty due to a false start. Albon's right wing mirror became detached from his car, resulting in double-waved yellow flags. The mirror was hit by Bottas, resulting in debris being scattered across the track. Hamilton and Sainz developed front-left punctures, although telemetry subsequently showed both drivers were seeing falling tyre pressure before passing the debris-covered area. Norris was given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty due to failing to slow under yellow flags, and Hamilton a drive-through for speeding in the pit lane. Zhou Guanyu finished eighth, earning him four points; both his and Sauber's first points of the season. Despite Verstappen's victory, Red Bull dropped out of contention for the Constructors' Championship.
