After Verstappen and Russell set identical lap times during qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix, Russell secured pole position by virtue of setting the time first. The race began under intermediate conditions. Ferrari recorded its first retirements of the season when Leclerc and Sainz failed to finish, with Leclerc experiencing engine issues. Sainz meanwhile spun at turn 7 and collected Albon, who was the last Williams on track at that time as Sargeant had retired earlier. This was Ferrari's first double retirement since the 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Sergio PÃ©rez, who got knocked out in Q1 for the second consecutive race weekend, failed to finish after he spun into the barrier, damaging the back of his RB20. He was later given a three-place grid penalty to be served in the following Spanish Grand Prix for trailing back to the pits with a damaged rear wing. Two safety car periods were observed during the race, which was won by Verstappen ahead of Norris and Russell, who recorded Mercedes' first podium of the season. Hamilton, who attained the fastest lap of the race, finished behind Russell in fourth, his best result of the season to date.
