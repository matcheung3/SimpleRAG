Red Bull Racing continued to show their pace at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix with Verstappen winning the race ahead of teammate PÃ©rez and Charles Leclerc, with Verstappen securing his 100th podium. While he led a majority of the race, a safety car caused by Lance Stroll's crash, which allowed a majority of the field to change their strategies, allowed McLaren's Lando Norris to inherit the lead temporarily before Verstappen overtook him. During the weekend, Sainz was affected with appendicitis, which resulted in his withdrawal from the event. In his place, Ferrari junior driver Oliver Bearman, who had secured pole position for the Formula 2 feature race that same weekend, stood in for Sainz while he underwent surgery. Bearman qualified eleventh and went on to finish seventh. Gasly retired on lap one due to a gearbox problem.
