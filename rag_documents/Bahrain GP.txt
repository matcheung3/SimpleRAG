The season began with a Red Bull Racing 1–2 at the Bahrain Grand Prix. Max Verstappen won the race ahead of teammate Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz Jr. After starting on pole, Verstappen led every lap and took fastest lap, for his fifth career grand slam. Charles Leclerc, who started on the front row, finished fourth after dealing with brake issues throughout the race. After finishing sixth in the Constructors' Championship in the previous year, Alpine performed below expectations: Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly qualified nineteenth and twentieth and finished the race in seventeenth and eighteenth, respectively.
