Norris and Piastri locked out the front row at the Hungarian Grand Prix, which was McLaren's first front-row lockout since the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix. Piastri led a majority of the race before Norris gained the lead via an undercut. McLaren invoked team orders on Norris, telling him to slow down and let Piastri by to take his maiden Grand Prix victory and McLaren's first 1–2 finish since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix, where Norris had also finished second to his teammate. The result meant they overtook Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship. Hamilton, having battled with Verstappen for the majority of the race, finished in third for his 200th career Formula One podium, and Verstappen, who criticised the car's pace and strategy options, ended up finishing in fifth after colliding with Hamilton. Meanwhile, Pérez, who was knocked out of Q1 after crashing out, recovered from sixteenth to seventh.
