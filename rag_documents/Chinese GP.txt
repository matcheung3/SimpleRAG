Despite taking pole for the Chinese Grand Prix, Verstappen struggled in qualifying for the first sprint weekend of the season, only qualifying fourth behind sprint pole-sitter Norris, followed by Hamilton and Fernando Alonso. At the beginning of the sprint, Hamilton took the lead from Norris, who slid down to seventh at the first turn. The former would lead for nearly half of the sprint's distance before Verstappen overtook him and won the sprint from Hamilton and Pérez. Verstappen went on to win the Grand Prix the next day from Norris and Pérez, meaning Ferrari did not score a podium for the first time this season.
