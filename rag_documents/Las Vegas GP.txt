Verstappen had a chance to secure his fourth World Drivers' Championship title at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with him being able to do so as long as he outscored Norris.[116] Russell took pole position and led a majority of the race from lights to flag, leading Hamilton, who endured a poor qualification, behind him. Russell secured his second win of the season, and this is the first time Russell won more than one Grand Prix in a single season. Additionally, Sainz and Leclerc finished in third and fourth, respectively, bridging closer Ferrari's gap to McLaren in the Constructors' Championship. Verstappen qualified and finished in fifth, with Norris behind him in sixth, allowing him to clinch his fourth consecutive title. Two retirements were observed, both due to mechanical issues: Pierre Gasly, who endured his best qualification of the season in third, and Alexander Albon due to overheating. Albon's teammate Franco Colapinto started from the pit lane after enduring a heavy crash in qualifying.
