Verstappen's run of nine wins in a row ended at the Australian Grand Prix, where he retired on lap four from a dislodging of his brake disc, marking his first retirement since the 2022 Australian Grand Prix. Returnee Sainz inherited the race lead and took his third career victory, with his teammate Charles Leclerc finishing second for Ferrari's first 1â€“2 finish since the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix. Norris completed the podium and succeeded Nick Heidfeld for the most podiums without a victory in Formula One, while Haas scored double points, and Yuki Tsunoda scored RB's first points, respectively. Additionally to Verstappen's retirement, both Mercedes drivers also did not finish the race, with Lewis Hamilton having an engine failure and George Russell hitting the wall heavily, ending his race on the last lap.
