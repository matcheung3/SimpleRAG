The Dutch Grand Prix marked the first race following the summer break. Norris took pole position for the race, but lost out to second-placed Verstappen at the start. Norris caught up to, and passed Verstappen and went on to win his second Grand Prix, by over twenty-two seconds, ahead of Verstappen; Leclerc completed a one-stop strategy to finish in third. Norris's victory marked McLaren's first at the venue since Niki Lauda's triumph in 1985, and ended a three-year streak of Verstappen victories at the Circuit Zandvoort since its reintroduction to the Formula One calendar in 2021.
