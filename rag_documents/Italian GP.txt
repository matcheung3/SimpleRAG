At the Italian Grand Prix, Norris and Piastri locked-out the front row for McLaren ahead of third-placed Russell with the Ferraris in fourth and fifth. Norris lost out at turn four to Piastri, and Russell sustained front-wing damage. Most teams opted to run a two-stop strategy, but Ferrari opted to run a one-stop strategy which Leclerc initially criticised. The one-stop strategy would pay off eventually, with Leclerc cycling into the lead ahead of Piastri. Leclerc kept his lead until the chequered flag was flown to win the Grand Prix, scoring Ferrari's first victory at their home race since 2019, which was also won by Leclerc. Piastri and Norris, the latter scoring the fastest lap on lap 53, rounded off the podium. The race also saw the debut of Franco Colapinto for Williams, the team replacing Logan Sargeant for the rest of the season. Colapinto finished twelfth in his debut race.
