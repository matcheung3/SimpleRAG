Verstappen qualified fastest for the Belgian Grand Prix, but took a grid penalty leaving second-fastest Leclerc on pole position. Hamilton jumped PÃ©rez off the line and overtook Leclerc in the opening laps to take the lead of the race before Russell shuffled into the lead following pit stops. Russell was running older hard tyres, but brought the car home without any further pit stops to take what was initially a victory ahead of Hamilton and Piastri. Russell was later disqualified post-race due to having an underweight car, promoting Hamilton to victory, Piastri to second and Leclerc to the podium.
