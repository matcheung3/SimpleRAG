Leclerc took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix, ending Verstappen's run of eight consecutive pole positions; the latter qualifying sixth on the grid. At the start, Pérez got into a crash with Magnussen and his teammate Nico Hülkenberg, causing a red flag. The Alpines of Ocon and Gasly also had a collision, with the former retiring as a result. Ocon received a grid penalty for the following race in Canada. Leclerc took his first win since the 2022 Austrian Grand Prix and the first at his home Grand Prix. Oscar Piastri took his first podium of the season in second, and Sainz finished third after originally dropping back on lap one as a result of a puncture caused by a collision with Piastri.
